# DL
Deep Learning - UPC
This subject aims to familiarize the student with the practical aspects of Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The theory classes will refresh the basic concepts of DL (CNNs, LSTMs, etc.), assuming some prior knowledge. Also, the most popular architectures will be introduced, as well as network configurations that have proved useful for specific problems. In the practical part, the student will have to carry out experiments using DL libraries, and experiment with the various components that have been proposed in the field. The lab sessions will be done on computational resources of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), which includes cutting-edge technologies.
