The goal of the project is to classify the animals and to be able to identify
their species. The data set used in this project was provided by Kaggle. It
contains about 28K medium quality animal images belonging to 10 categories:
dog, cat, horse, spider, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel and elephant.
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class
of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
Therefore, we will use CNN in this study to achieve our goal.
